## Overview
IdeaAI is a project designed to leverage artificial intelligence for remote desktop controlling. It uses Node.js, Socket.io, and Redis to manage concurrent events and ensure efficient data processing.

## Features
- Real-time remote desktop control
- Concurrent event handling with Redis locks
- Event blocking and unblocking mechanism

## Algorithm
The core algorithm of IdeaAI involves:
1. **Connection Establishment**: When a client connects to the server, a new socket connection is established.
2. **Event Handling**: The client sends events (e.g., mouse clicks) to the server. The server attempts to acquire a lock using Redis to ensure only one event is processed at a time.
3. **Lock Management**: If the lock is acquired, the server processes the event and blocks other events by emitting a `block_cursor` event to all clients.
4. **Event Processing**: The server processes the event and simulates a delay to represent the processing time.
5. **Lock Release**: After processing the event, the server releases the lock and emits an `unblock_cursor` event to all clients, allowing new events to be processed.

## Redis Usage
Redis is used in IdeaAI for:
- **Session Management**: Storing session data to maintain the state of remote desktop sessions.
- **Caching**: Caching frequently accessed data to improve performance.
- **Lock Management**: Managing locks to handle concurrent events and ensure only one event is processed at a time.

## Theory
The theoretical foundation of IdeaAI includes:
- **Machine Learning**: Training models to understand and predict user actions.
- **Computer Vision**: Capturing and interpreting the state of the desktop.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Understanding user commands and translating them into actions.

## Use Cases
IdeaAI can be used in various scenarios, including:
- **Remote IT Support**: Technicians can control and troubleshoot user desktops remotely.
- **Virtual Classrooms**: Instructors can interact with student desktops to provide guidance.
- **Remote Work**: Employees can access and control their office desktops from home.
