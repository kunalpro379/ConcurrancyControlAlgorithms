## Overview
This is a Algorithm of handling concurrency in remote desktop control. It uses Node.js, Socket.io, and Redis to manage concurrent events and ensure efficient data processing.

## Features
- Real-time remote desktop control Algorithm
- Concurrent event handling with Redis locks
- Event blocking and unblocking mechanism

## Algorithm
The core algorithm involves:
1. **Connection Establishment**: When a client connects to the server, a new socket connection is established.
2. **Event Handling**: The client sends events (e.g., mouse clicks) to the server. The server attempts to acquire a lock using Redis to ensure only one event is processed at a time.
3. **Lock Management**: If the lock is acquired, the server processes the event and blocks other events by emitting a `block_cursor` event to all clients.
4. **Event Processing**: The server processes the event and simulates a delay to represent the processing time.
5. **Lock Release**: After processing the event, the server releases the lock and emits an `unblock_cursor` event to all clients, allowing new events to be processed.

## Redis Usage
Redis is used in this Algorithm for:
- **Session Management**: Storing session data to maintain the state of remote desktop sessions.
- **Caching**: Caching frequently accessed data to improve performance.
- **Lock Management**: Managing locks to handle concurrent events and ensure only one event is processed at a time.

## Use Cases
This Algorithm can be used in various scenarios, including:
- **Remote IT Support**: Technicians can control and troubleshoot user desktops remotely.
- **Virtual Classrooms**: Instructors can interact with student desktops to provide guidance.
- **Remote Work**: Employees can access and control their office desktops from home.

## Getting Started
To get started with this Algorithm, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/IdeaAI.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies.
   ```bash
   cd IdeaAI
   npm install
   ```
3. Configure Redis and other necessary services.
4. Run the server.
   ```bash
   node ConcurrentEventsRedis/index.js
   ```
5. Run the client.
   ```bash
   node ConcurrentEventsRedis/client.js
   ```
